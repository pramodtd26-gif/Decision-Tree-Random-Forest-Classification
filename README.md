#Decision-Tree-Random-Forest-Classification
Lending Club Loan Risk Analysis & Default Prediction

This project analyzes Lending Club loan data to predict whether a borrower will default. The aim is to understand credit risk factors and build a reliable predictive model.

📌 Project Objectives

Clean and preprocess the Lending Club dataset

Analyze borrower-level financial patterns

Identify key variables influencing loan default

Build machine learning models to predict default risk

Evaluate model performance and interpret results
